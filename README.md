# Memory Game Project

This is a memory game made as a project for the Front-end Developer Nanodegree, at Udacity.

## Instructions

This is a classic memory game where you have to match all the cards which have the same symbol. So you have to click on a square to reveal its symbol and then find the other square which contains the same symbol. If the cards match, they'll become green, if they don't, they'll become red and hide again.

### Difficulty level

There are **3 difficulty level**, which affect the number of cards you have to match. The higher the level, the larger the deck of cards you have to face. Any time you change the difficulty level, the game resets.

### Reset

There is a **reset** button on the right side of the top area of the screen. Whenever you press it, the game will restart and all data (moves, matches, time and rating) will reset.

## Rating system

Your rating is shown by **5 stars** at the top of the screen. When you start the game, a timer starts as well. At a certain amount of time passed, a star becomes black, which means you lost a point. When the game ends, the remaining stars show your rating level and _Confucio_ gives you some teaching you may find usefull :) Remember that rating level depends also on the difficuly level.

## End of game

The game ends either matching all cards or finishing your time. The time limit is **666 seconds**, but you better not reaching it or something really **evil** will happen.
